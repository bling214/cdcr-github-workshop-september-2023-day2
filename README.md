# CDCR Github Workshop September 2023

This repository is for the CDCR Github 3-Day Workshop in September 2023. As the workshop delivery will be as open and candid as possible within the NDA, no recording will be allowed. However, the content will be made available here for reference and review.

## Who is this for?

This workshop is for CDCR employees who are interested in learning more about Github and how it can be used to improve their development process:

- Software development engineers (*the "dev" part*)
- Systems engineers (*the "ops" part*)
- Solution architects and software development leads
- Quality engineers
- Business analysts
- Software building project managers
- Security engineers who intend to be part of a "DevSecOps" team

Regardless of your level of experience with GitHub, you will leave this workshop with a better understanding of how to use it to improve your development process and collaborate with your team members.

## What this is not

- This workshop is not intended to teach you how to code
  - When code is referenced in the workshop it will be provided to you
    - ðŸš¨ *Spoiler Alert*: we will build and deploy a simple web application using .NET and Blazor WASM to both GitHub Pages and Azure
  - If you have questions related to the provided code you may ask them during the Q&A section of the workshop
- This workshop is not intended to teach you how to use Git Commands
  - You will be shown the commands needed primarily using the GitHub Desktop client application
  - If you want to get familiar with Git, you may want to take the [Git Basics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/intro-to-vc-git/) learning path on Microsoft Learn
